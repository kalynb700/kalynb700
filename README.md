ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world! I'm Kalyn
ðŸŽ“ a Senior studying Computer Science at San Jose State University (SJSU)
ðŸ”­ Aspiring software engineer with an interest in sustainability, and machine learning

As of late, I've been working on developing my skillsets in machine learning, full-stack development, and basic electrical engineering. That said, I've been researching AI capabilities and other computer science applications in addition to attending tech panels led by experts in their respective fields. I'm particularly dedicated to finding ways to enhance and engineer technology to help combat climate change and other environmental issues. Computer science and otherwise data analytics play a major role in predicting climate trends and compiling information. My dream is to work alongside others who are just as devoted to improving the environment to innovate existing or new technology. 

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
Languages: Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS
Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
Web Dev: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic)
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Git, GitHub
Databases: SQL, MySQL

âœ¨ Fun Fact:
I love learning new things and in my free time I like to incorporate sustainable materials into my arts and crafts projects, make ceramic/polymer clay sculptures, build minature models, do wood-working, customize dolls, needle felt, and more! 
Sustainabilty and the environment are a huge part of my life, and I'm continuing to learn more about compost, recycling, and clean energy in my free time. 
As a rat enthusiast, my friends sometimes call me "Cheese". Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments, I'd be cheesed to meet you all!
